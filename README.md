## **Vancouver Guide** 

Vancouver Guide is a unique travel guide dedicated to Vancouver and its marvelous surrounding areas. At Vancouver Guide, we will rely on each and every one of our users to help us build the most comprehensive travel guide for the beautiful city of Vancouver. Each attraction is automatically assigned proper location on the map, but in the rare event that the location found automatically by the API is not accurate, it will be changed shortly by an admin. Vancouver Guide is a fully responsive web application working perfectly on all common screen sizes. 

Users of the website are not required to sign up to use the travel guide and have access to all the information they need regarding relevant attractions. However, logged in users are the ones who are allowed to post new attractions, comment on posts, and basically get access to user-only sections of the website. 

Like any similar web app, users can choose to view attractions only in a specific category or search for a specific attraction, which is of course handled by an AJAX call. They can also easily rearrange posts based on their own preferences. 

Vancouver Guide includes an admin panel for us to easily verify posts, verify comments, and possibly flag some users to limit their access to certain sections. This way we can make sure that such day-to-day operations can be done easily and without modifying the source code or directly accessing the database. 

It should be noted that all due diligence is taken to make sure the personal information of our users is stored safely in our database. We have used hashing and salting algorithms for storing user passwords to make sure that our users and their passwords are safe even if our database is breached for any reason out of our control.
